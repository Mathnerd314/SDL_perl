Perl SDL Hacking Guide.

TODO: make this a little more complete guide

It is prolly high time we grabbed one of these.

Right now there are three branchs in work.

[SWIN] 1. Perl Developed Version (version 2) ("stable")
[INXS] 2. XS Developed Version (version 3) (testing)
[GROG] 3. Swig (version 4) (experimental)
[TABL] 4. Layout of packages
[BUGS] 5. Feedback

[SWIN] 1. Perl Developed Version (version 2)

location: $PERLSDL/lib

Version 2 of lib Perl is working on being discontinued. There were more 
than a few issues running the code produced in anything that could be 
called a production environment.

You are more than welcome to patch this code and use it. However development 
has moved onto other sections that have shown to be somewhat more effectiver.

[INXS] 2. XS Developed Version (version 3) (testing)

location: $PERLSDL/src

This is version 3. This is in the redesign branch of this sets of works. This 
is more or less what is being worked with right now. Mostly finding issues 
are now originating in bugs in libSDL and even some implementations of X11R7.
If we do figure out a patch to those, we will send it to libSDL or the 
implementation of X11R7 requiring it.

Development is going well.

[GROG] 3. Swig (version 4) (experimental)

location: $PERLSDL/swig

Version 4 has only recently started development, and largely should not work 
in any form. Hence the experimental tag. We will keep you posted.

[TABL] 4. Layout of Packages

Generally it is fairly simple.

We have:

SDL::.*

Which contains packages required to the base running of Perl SDL

SDL::Game::.*

Which contains extensions and additions that make games easier to construct.

[BUGS] 5. Bugs

Prolly your best bet is to do one of a few things:

Check out #sdl on irc.perl.org in your perl client.

Check out the Perl SDL bug tracker <note for later: insert URL>
